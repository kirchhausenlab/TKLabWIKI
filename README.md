# Updating Lab Wiki for Everyone

To get the code on your computer, please ensure you have git installed and ask Arkash Jain to add you to the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/TKLabWIKI.git
```

Simply go under **contents > docs ** and make a new folder for wiki if it doesn't exist. Please make an empty `_index.md` file first.

Then name whatever file you want to create and end it with a **.md** extension

## Making Docs

**Setup**

Make a title, date, and say draft as false for the new page

```bash
---
title: "GitHub"
date: 2024-08-15
draft: false
---
```

After this, treat every "webpage" as a readme and format it as you would a README
