      <description>CryoSamba: Self-Supervised Cryo-ET Image Denoising # Abstract # Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) has rapidly advanced as a high-resolution imaging tool for visualizing subcellular structures in 3D with molecular detail. Direct image inspection remains challenging due to inherent low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). We introduce CryoSamba, a self-supervised deep learning-based model designed for denoising cryo-ET images. CryoSamba enhances single consecutive 2D planes in tomograms by averaging motion-compensated nearby planes through deep learning interpolation, effectively mimicking increased exposure.</description>

      <title>Poetry: Python Dependency Management Made Easy</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/python/production_poetry/</guid>
      <description>Poetry # Explanation # Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.&#xA;Poetry uses a file called pyproject.toml to declare your project dependencies. It then creates a virtual environment and installs the specified dependencies in that environment. Poetry also locks the versions of your dependencies to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <description>Using Conda Environment # Explanation # Conda is a popular package and environment management system that allows you to create and manage isolated environments for different projects. This guide will walk you through the steps of using Conda to create and manage environments.&#xA;Conda works by creating isolated environments that contain their own set of packages and dependencies. This allows you to work on different projects with different requirements without conflicts.</description>

      <description>Virtual Environment # Explanation # A virtual environment is like a separate workspace for your code. Imagine you have a desk where you do your work, and on that desk, you have different projects spread out. Each project has its own set of tools, materials, and files.&#xA;Similarly, in programming, a virtual environment is a self-contained space where you can work on different projects without them interfering with each other.</description>

      <description>Accessing Resources Off-site with Key-Based SSH # Purpose # When accessing resources from off-site, such as running a Jupyter notebook on tkl1 or tkl3 or exploring data with Neuroglancer, it can be cumbersome to first SSH onto xtal200 and authenticate with 2FA. This guide will show you how to streamline this process by using key-based SSH, allowing you to access applications served by on-site resources in a single SSH step.</description>

A Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter to identify local maxima. Local maxima at significant locations are used to initialize model fitting, which estimates fluorescence signal amplitude, local background, and sub-pixel location [2]. This code is designed for PSF-like particles; intensity estimates are less reliable for extended objects (e.</description>
