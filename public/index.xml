      <description>CryoSamba: Self-Supervised Cryo-ET Image Denoising # Abstract # Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) has rapidly advanced as a high-resolution imaging tool for visualizing subcellular structures in 3D with molecular detail. Direct image inspection remains challenging due to inherent low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). We introduce CryoSamba, a self-supervised deep learning-based model designed for denoising cryo-ET images. CryoSamba enhances single consecutive 2D planes in tomograms by averaging motion-compensated nearby planes through deep learning interpolation, effectively mimicking increased exposure.</description>

      <title>Poetry: Python Dependency Management Made Easy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/python/production_poetry/</link>

      <description>Poetry # Explanation # Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.&#xA;Poetry uses a file called pyproject.toml to declare your project dependencies. It then creates a virtual environment and installs the specified dependencies in that environment. Poetry also locks the versions of your dependencies to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <description>Using Conda Environment # Explanation # Conda is a popular package and environment management system that allows you to create and manage isolated environments for different projects. This guide will walk you through the steps of using Conda to create and manage environments.&#xA;Conda works by creating isolated environments that contain their own set of packages and dependencies. This allows you to work on different projects with different requirements without conflicts.</description>

      <description>Virtual Environment # Explanation # A virtual environment is like a separate workspace for your code. Imagine you have a desk where you do your work, and on that desk, you have different projects spread out. Each project has its own set of tools, materials, and files.&#xA;Similarly, in programming, a virtual environment is a self-contained space where you can work on different projects without them interfering with each other.</description>

      <description>SBGrid Wiki # They support many labs, who all use the suite of tools differently. Much of the wiki is dedicated to support for labs that use the SBGrid GUI and program browser, but there is still useful information for our lab When you encounter an IT issue, the best thing to do is create a help ticket by emailing help@sbgrid.org. Nine times of ten, the person responding will be Justin O‚ÄôConnor, who dedicates extra time from his schedule to managing TK Lab computing infrastructure.</description>
