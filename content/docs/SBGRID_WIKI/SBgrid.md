### [SBGrid Wiki](#https://sbgrid.org/wiki/SBGrid-Wiki.md)

They support many labs, who all use the suite of tools differently. Much of the wiki is dedicated to support for labs that use the SBGrid GUI and program browser, but there is still useful information for our lab
When you encounter an IT issue, the best thing to do is create a help ticket by emailing help@sbgrid.org. Nine times of ten, the person responding will be Justin Oâ€™Connor, who dedicates extra time from his schedule to managing TK Lab computing infrastructure.
Code managed by you as a user (such as a GitHub repo you install and build from source) will be in your home folder. But software packages such as MATLAB, will be accessed from an SBGrid network installation managed by SBGrid. This ensures version parity when people access the same program from many different computers.
