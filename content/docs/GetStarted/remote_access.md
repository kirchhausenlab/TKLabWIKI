## Access Remote Machines

The TKLAB has 10% of the total compute of Harvard Med with the following severs:

- 3 DGXs equipped with 24 Nvidia A100 GPUs,
- tkl1, tkl2, tkl3, tkl4,
- Datasync folders with terrabytes of capacity
- Scratch folders for developers
- In total having over 800 CPUs and 30 GPUs

To access one of the machines, we have the following:

1. On the Harvard Ethernet Network:
   Run the following commands from your terminal

```bash
ssh username@tkdgx3.med.harvard.edu
>> your password
```

An example would be:

```
‚ùØ ssh ajain@tkdgx3.med.harvard.edu                                                                (base)

2. For a remote machine, please first ssh into xtal200 and have a duo account setup.

```bash
ssh username@xtal200.med.harvard.edu
```

You will be prompted to authenticate yourself on duo before a request for your password. Once done, type the ssh commands as if you would for your local machine

**Example**

```

3. To Use a remote desktop, please log onto a tklab server remotely (\*\*not the dgxs or xtal200) or locally and run the following command:
   `xdesk.sh`

```
Last login: Mon Aug 19 09:11:40 2024 from 10.117.38.200
ajain@tkl1:~$ xdesk.sh
duplicate session: xpra-desktop
Session already running. - Connect to http://tkl1.med.harvard.edu:8660 with password ***
- ssh -L 9999:tkl1.med.harvard.edu:8660 ajain@xtal200.harvard.edu - leave this running
- Then open a web browser to http://localhost:9999 and fill the password field with ***
For troubleshooting see session with \'tmux a -t xpra-desktop\' then use Ctrl-c to terminate
Or use the command xpra stop
ajain@tkl1:~$
```

Then navigate to the link given (localhost:9999) from above and enter the password to access a desktop remotely

4. Chrome Remote Desktop:
   - Install the Chrome Remote Desktop extension from the Chrome Web Store
   - Follow the instructions to set up the extension
   - Once set up, you can access the remote desktop from the Chrome Remote Desktop app on your local machine

Or from a web browser, navigate to [remotedesktop.google.com](https://remotedesktop.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. You can then access the remote desktop from the web interface.
The email address associated with the Google account must be added to the list of users who can access the remote desktop. Ours is:

```bash
link - https://remotedesktop.google.com/u/4/access?pli=1
tklab@tklab.hms.harvard.edu
```

We also have a PIN and password which can be shared with you upon request.
